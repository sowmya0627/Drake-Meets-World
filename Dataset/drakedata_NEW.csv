You know a wise man once said nothin' at all I'm exhausted and drained I can't even pretend All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?

scorpion,2018,Is There More,"Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest Only problems I do are math problems with profit Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses Only rest that I do is ""Where the rest of my commas?"" Still I rise Maya Angelou vibes When life comin' at you from all angles and sides And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside It really boils down to how you plan to survive Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em Give 'em nice things but what's that to 'em? Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom And they recognize the bathroom All hell starts to break loose in my texts I only tell lies to who I gotta protect I would rather have you remember me how we met I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step That ain't what I'm 'bout I'm in control of my destiny never in doubt If I can't make it with you I'll make it without They say take the good with the bad I'll take it without Houston women I wine and dine and take to the house My moral compass is janky it breaks in the South Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts? Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out? Is there more? Yeah Sweeter the berry the blacker the juice The Boy is back in the booth ready to tap into truth Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot Too many Walt Disney characters mouses and goofs I mean you know I love a challenge but challenged by who? I'll let you bring a thousand recruits My peers are a talented group But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops There's still nothin' they could really do It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due Whenever it's time to recoup Yeah soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal In the house playin' D'Angelo ""How Does It Feel?"" I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die What you got? Time on your hands or time on your side? Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high? Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai? Yachts on the 4th of July G5 soarin' the skies Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties And all of these fortunate times And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size? Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find? Like healin' my soul like family time Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive? Is there more? Passion instant Sweat beads feel me (feel me) Cupid's shot me My heartbeat's racing (my heartbeat's racing) Tempt me drive me (tempt me) It feels so exciting Thought of highly (highly) It's yours entirely I'll be I'll be more than a lover More than a woman More than a lover for you"

You saw it in me at 20 years old The lingo start to sound like we talking in code I got a pure soul I don't do the hate You don't worry 'bout fitting in when you custom made Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game Still drop 40 with liquor in my system Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian Lamborghini got me feeling like I'm Christian Bale And I never bare my morals for the ticket sales Tipping scales bars heavy like triple XL I never tag no one in I'd rather get you myself Running through the 6 storming through the contracts I'm possessed you can see it under the contacts They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon I still got something left to prove since you left me room Paint a plan for the family debt we in the minus And like it's going in a trunk I put it all behind us Where you tryna go? I got it I'll take us wherever I'm a staple in the game all my papers together And my life is on display like Truman They wanna pre the movements gotta start to make 'em sooner My exes made some of my favorite music I dated women from my favorite movies Karma's such a thing of beauty I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you If I was you I wouldn't like me either"

But we not we just kill the summer every single time I come around Never chase hoes but we do we laugh at them n ggas tryin to run em down Not I not me YMOB call jaz call c Bet both of them would agree Get viewed get judged get booed get loved Shit get done round here do you not us I'm gon do what I want Cause this lifes made for living You got to know nothings for sure Faith in the stars I'm gon do what I want Cause this lifes what I'm given Gotta keep my faith in the dark clouds Once upon a time I met On this cold explosive dosage she wrote this But tell me who chose this Sin citys innocent really when its inside my mind And co sign with a rhyme and a big pen Once again its an even odd Cant applaud with one hand Cant be God with one fan Or can you stan you If not pastor jackson daniels rip that hit that Now I sip that lightly when I'm on my mic tightly And I write nightly like Spike Lee Let me break it down I been having a maid since the 8th grade with a fade Rapping by the swings And the bell never really rings Class in session there's no recession For this upper echelon mic testing its K dash O S F R E S H in the place With a grace in and outta space Gotta race Don't be something that you really not Sabotage the universal plot When the planet earth rock gets hot From the sun don't get got just get God yeah see that (Do you believe)

Your up on a pedastal Are we moving too fast? Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past Is why I gotta ask... is anything I'm doing brand new? Brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new is anything I'm doing brand new? Brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new This here is something personal I highly doubt this feeling is reversible Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside So I don't ever question you and damn I cant even find the perfect brush So I can paint whats going through my mind Racing against myself but I'm a couple steps behind This why I gotta ask is anything I'm doing brand new? Brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new is anything I'm doing brand new? Brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new Is anything I'm doing brand (new) Or is everything I'm doing too (late) Did he take off your clothes off just like this Did he give you loving just like this Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date Tell me baby am I too late? is anything I'm doing brand new?
